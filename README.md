# Supply-Chain-Risk-Analytics



## 📌 Project Overview

**Supply Chain Risk Analytics** is an end-to-end data analytics & machine learning project that identifies and predicts supply chain delay risks using historical operational data.

This project is designed to look **industry-ready**, **interview-ready**, and **GitHub-public safe** for **Data Analyst / AI & Data Science freshers**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Supply chain delays and inventory shortages lead to revenue loss, customer dissatisfaction, and operational inefficiencies.

Organizations need a **data-driven system** to:

* Identify high-risk orders
* Understand key delay factors
* Predict delay risk in advance

---

## ✅ Solution

This system builds a complete analytics pipeline that:

* Generates realistic supply chain data
* Performs data validation & EDA
* Engineers business-relevant features
* Predicts delay risk using ML
* Produces a **risk score** for each order
* Exports high-risk orders for business action

---

## 🧠 Key Features

* End-to-end Python pipeline
* Logistic Regression risk model
* Business-focused feature engineering
* ROC-AUC based evaluation
* High-risk order identification
* Clean, readable & reproducible code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
